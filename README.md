### Hi, I’m @Austin-Buchanan

I’m a software developer with professional experience programming integration flows, REST APIs, and database procedures. 

My programming career began in 2020 when I started scripting in PowerShell to help automate tasks for an IT helpdesk. 
I was promoted in 2021 to an application support role where I started writing in SQL for database queries and emergency fixes. 
In 2022, I moved over to the development side, where I specialized in IIB/ACE integration flows and REST APIs. 
Since moving halfway across the country in 2024 and taking a new position, I've specialized as an SSIS programmer using SQL and C# to automate various database integrations. 

For my personal projects, I've enjoyed making desktop apps, REST APIs, and console applications in Python and JavaScript. 

I'm currently working on a fullstack web app that utilizes JavaScript for the frontend and C# (ASP.NET) for the backend. Stay tuned to see more on that in the near future!
