### Hi, I’m @Austin-Buchanan

I’m a software developer with professional experience coding IIB/ACE integration flows and REST APIs. I started programming in 2019 by making personal web apps with JavaScript, but I quickly became interested in APIs and the movement of data between applications. In 2022 I became an integration developer working primarily with IIB and ACE, although I dabbled in Java development and Python scripting. In January 2024, though, my wife and I decided to move from the Midwest to Washington state to start a new chapter in our lives. I'm now looking for new development work, so feel free to reach out to me if you like what you see here. 

These days I'm working on a few different personal Python projects and learning how to make games in Godot with C#.
